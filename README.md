# Jamie Miller - Maybe Next Time ðŸŽ§ðŸŽµ

**[Verse 1]**

Mom says trust your gut but I think mine's broken

'Cause I could swear that we were meant to be

Standing on your doorstep, now I'm frozen

How are these the words you're telling me?

**[Pre-Chorus]**

Now I'm all alone, I know it too well

And I know it won't help, but I'm telling myself

**[Chorus]**

Maybe next time I'll be enough

You'll give me everything instead of givin' up

Maybe next time won't be a waste

You'll be the one and not the one that got away

So, I count down the days till I won't have to say

**[Post-Chorus]**

Maybe next time

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Maybe next time

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

**[Verse 2]**

Don't know why I watched when I know the ending

Wanna skip right to the part, it doesn't hurt

Thinking that night, boarding that flight

With a bruised up heart and a carry-on bag

A long-lost love that I'll never get back, wanna get it back

**[Chorus]**

Maybe next time I'll be enough

You'll give me everything instead of givin' up

Maybe next time won't be a waste

You'll be the one and not the one that got away

So, I count down the days till I won't have to say

**[Post-Chorus]**

Maybe next time

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Maybe next time

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

**[Bridge]**

Maybe next time I'll be enough

You'll give me everything instead of givin' up

And maybe next time won't be a waste

You'll be the one and not the one that got away

So, I count down the days till I won't have to say

**[Outro]**

Oh, I count out the days till I won't have to say

Maybe next time
